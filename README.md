# Chatbox
I created a chatbox with django
The virtual environment I created was not allowed to be uploaded on github, so if you want to accesss this project, you have to create a virtual environment and install
Django
Channels
Channel_redis
Selenium
And the chat box will work


It is actually the first one I have created, I will do better on my next personal projects, But It too me 9 long hrs to create this. I have a whole duplex of rooms for improvement hahahaha
